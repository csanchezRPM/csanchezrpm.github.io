# App Update with Social Media Links

## Overview
Once a week, REQUESTOR has been manually exporting all location social media links from APP and importing all of it into APP to keep the system updated. She has requested assistance in automating this process.
We agreed upon updating only locations with changes, so our process will need to incorporate querying APP and comparing to APP before moving the data.
We have the power to edit a locationâ€™s name, active status, phone number, email, and all social media links. It has been decided we will only update the links for now.
